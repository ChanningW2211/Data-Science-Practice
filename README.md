# Data-Science-Practice
A repository to journey through my data science practice.
+ Shackled by a computer science mindset, I try to break down all practice into two categories: 
	+ statistical modelling that focus on statistics and machine learning that focuses on algorithms. However, there's inevitably some overlapping between the two.
    + And, the practice in each category are guided by an updating theoretical bases from different sources (mostly my lecture notes and extended readings that are recommended by lecturers). 
+ All codes are written in RMarkdown (R) and Jupyter Notebook (Python) to produce a readable report in pdf.
